    "The Runescape API is a <u>disappointment</u>, so I just scraped the market (Grand Exchange prices for items) data from the fan site at <a href='http://www.grandexchangewatch.com/'>GrandExchangeWatch</a>. It took a couple of days to store years of item price data into a MongoDB collection, but there was also the problem of cleaning said data.\n",

    "It comes with a ~30MB zip file which expands into a 3.5 million line CSV file (~300MB), and some notebooks for scraping the fan site, and a basic super simple analysis page which took my old dataset, cleaned it, and tossed a polynomial curve onto a single item's history.\n",
