      "The best guide to getting into the field of data science has been a tiny repo on Github called \"go\" which can be seen <a href='https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go'>here.</a>\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it is a thorough guide, there's too much noise and it's actually overwhelming to see so many different topics to study at once. I have now compiled a shorter and more straightforward guide to getting into data science without sacrificing theory or practice. \n",

      "<li>Get acquainted with 3 courses of calculus (differential, integral, multivariate) and make sure to not skim over partial derivatives and gradients.\n",
      "<li>Learn about linear algebra. You don't need a proof based course, <a href='http://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-4th/dp/0030105676/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427744788&sr=1-1&keywords=linear+algebra+and+applications'>and a good book (any edition) for this is written by Gilbert Strang</a>\n",

      "<li>Get some probability and statistics under your belt! I recommend <a href='http://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/0387402721'>\"All of Statistics\" by Larry Wasserman.</a> This is a hard book, so it's okay to only read the first part of it on Probability (section I up to ~87 pages?) for now. You will however want to read the rest of it for list item #9.\n",

It doesn't matter which you start with because after you've mastered one, you should learn the other... eventually. <a href='http://learnpythonthehardway.org/'>Here's</a> where you should learn Python, and <a href='http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/'>here's</a> where you should look to start learning R.
